# CARS (Comprehensive Automobile Emissions Research Simulator)
Comprehensive Automobile Research System (CARS) is an open-source and python-based mobile emission inventory model designed to efficiently provide high-resolution and high-quality mobile emission data for the air quality forecast system. 

The CARS is licensed as open-source python software that was developed with the funding from South Korea. The CARS has five independent modules to produce the emission data for the chemical transport model (CTM), including the arrangement of vehicle activity data, calculating the emission factors for each vehicle type, operating the link-level road shapefile, and outputting the emission data.
