# Introduction of CARS (Comprehensive Automobile Emissions Research Simulator)

Konkuk University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) have been working closely to develop the bottom-up emission inventory for on-road and non-road mobile sources using their local emissions factors by vehicle, by fuel, by vehicle operating speed, and by ambient temperature (limited only to diesel hot engine exhaust emissions). While Konkuk University is responsible for collecting the latest of Koreaâ€™s official emissions factors and developing the local mobile source-related activity data, such as vehicle-specific total Vehicle Kilometer Travelled (VKT), vehicle ages, fuel type, and so on, UNC-CH is responsible for developing the new Korea on-road/non-road mobile emissions model called Comprehensive Automobile Research Modeling System (CARS) as a part of Korea Air Quality Modeling System (KAQMS) development to enhance the quality and accuracy of model prediction by providing a better quality emissions from mobile sources.
