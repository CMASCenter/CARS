# CARS figure output
The CARS model can generate different output data, such as total district emission, link-level emission, and grid cell emission for CTM input. For example, the PM2.5 mobile emission in Seoul City is presented in three different formats in Fig. 7. Fig. 7a shows the annual mobile PM2.5 emissions by districts in Seoul city. The road link level annual emission rate for Seoul city is present in Fig. 7b. Further, the CARS model applied the link-level emission in Fig 7b to generate the hourly grid cell emission data with 1 km ï‚´ 1 km resolution for CTM in Fig. 7c.
